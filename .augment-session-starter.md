# Augment Code Session Starter

Please load and follow the instructions from these files:
1. llm/svelte5_full_context.txt
2. llm/svelte5_typescript.txt

Read both files completely and use their contents as your instructions 
for this session.

Also, please following these coding style guidelines:

* Use code comments sparingly. Don't add comments that are obvious.
* Use arrow functions where possible
* Use semicolons
* Functions that handle the `onSubmit` name `onSubmit`
* Where possible, create atomic components with the Svelte 5 handling of `props`
* Make sure components are only given the props they need
* Don't use `import { page } from '$app/stores';`. Use `import { page } from '$app/state';`.

When you make changes, run the following checks:

1. Make sure your changes are best-practice for Svelte 5 and don't use deprecated features, such 
   as `on:click`, or the Svelte 4 way of handling stores and events. 
2. Run`sv check` to make sure there are no errors.
